#### How does CSS affect HTML

Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:

1) A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example, I want 
my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red. 2) A selector, which selects 
the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example, I want to apply my CSS rule to 
all the paragraphs in my HTML document. 

A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage 
should look.
